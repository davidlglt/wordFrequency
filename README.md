WordFrequency
=============

This library is meant to give unique words with their frequency within a text ordered by descending frequencies.

If you create a file in_file.txt and write that text in it :"How do you do?"
You will end up with that file out_file.csv with
"do, 2"
"how, 1"
"you, 1"

* create a file named "in_file.txt"
* copy within this file the text you want to process
* execute the runner :  "javac Runner.java"
